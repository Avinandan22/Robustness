## Abstract

Machine learning (ML) and AI rely on massive, uncurated datasets, where verifying data quality is often impractical. As AI models increasingly incorporate input from untrusted users, they become more vulnerable to carefully orchestrated attacks that can compromise their reliability.

Adversarial data poisoning poses significant cybersecurity risks, ranging from life-threatening misdiagnoses to market disruptions. As illustrated in Table 1, these attacks can vary depending on the stage at which they occur, during training or deployment.

</Figure>

Currently, much research focuses on certifying model robustness against static adversaries that modify a portion of the offline dataset before the training algorithm is applied (as shown in Figure 1). For backdoor attack certification, studies typically involve adversaries poisoning offline datasets in a single step, making these attacks non-dynamic.

Dynamically optimized attack strategies enhance the effectiveness of adversarial poisoning. Online attackers can observe the trained algorithm in real time and adapt their poisoning tactics to the evolving behavior of the ML model.

This is particularly true for models that are continuously or periodically updated, such as those involved in fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

We introduce a new way to protect ML systems from dynamic data poisoning attacks. We developed a framework that helps us measure how much an attack could affect the model, and we use these measurements to create learning algorithms that can better handle such attacks.

## Figures

Use the figure component to display images, videos, equations, or any other element, with an optional caption.

  <Image slot="figure" source={transformer} altText="Diagram of the transformer deep learning architecture." />
  <span slot="caption">Diagram of the transformer deep learning architecture.</span>
</Figure>

## Image comparison slider

An interactive, accessible slider component with keyboard navigation.
<Figure>
  <ImageComparison slot="figure" client:load imageUrlOne={dogsDiffc.src} imageUrlTwo={dogsTrue.src} altTextOne="Photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water, lossily compressed using the DiffC algorithm" altTextTwo="Original photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water" />
  <span slot="caption">A photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water, lossily compressed using the <a href="https://jeremyiv.github.io/diffc-project-page/">DiffC algorithm</a>.</span>
</Figure>

## Two columns

Use the two columns component to display two columns of content. In this example, the first column contains a figure with a YouTube video and the second column contains a figure with a custom [React](https://react.dev/) component. By default, they display side by side, but if the screen is narrow enough (for example, on mobile), they're arranged vertically.

<TwoColumns>
  <Figure slot="left">
    <YouTubeVideo slot="figure" videoId="wjZofJX0v4M" />
    <span slot="caption">Take a look at this YouTube video.</span>
  </Figure>
  <Figure slot="right">
    <Splat slot="figure" client:idle />
    <span slot="caption">Now look at this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_splatting">Gaussian splat</a>, rendered with a React component.</span>
  </Figure>
</TwoColumns>

## Heading levels

Use headings to divide your content into sections.

### Heading 3

Go down a level to heading 3...

#### Heading 4

...and down again to heading 4.

## LaTeX

You can also add LaTeX formulas, rendered during the build process using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) so they're quick to load for visitors of your project page. You can write them inline, like this: <LaTeX inline formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />. Or, you can write them as a block:

<LaTeX formula="\int_a^b f(x) dx" />

## Tables

You can add simple tables using [GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables):

| Model | Accuracy | F1 score | Training time (hours) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| BERT-base | 0.89 | 0.87 | 4.5 |
| RoBERTa-large | 0.92 | 0.91 | 7.2 |
| DistilBERT | 0.86 | 0.84 | 2.1 |
| XLNet | 0.90 | 0.89 | 6.8 |
